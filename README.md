This is a restaurant website I designed using **HTML** and **CSS** to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

### Features:

- **Hero Section**: A stunning introductory section with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button.
- **Responsive Layout**: The website adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
- **Smooth Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects that enhance user engagement.
- **Fixed Navigation**: Easy navigation that stays accessible as the user scrolls.
- **Warm Color Tones**: Carefully chosen color palette to create a welcoming and cozy atmosphere.

### Key Programming Concepts:

1. **HTML (Structure)**:
   - Used elements like `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<button>` to structure the page.
   - Created the Hero Section with text content and an engaging call-to-action button.

2. **CSS (Styling)**:
   - Applied **Flexbox** and **Grid** for a flexible layout.
   - Customized typography, buttons, and backgrounds for an appealing design.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured that the website works perfectly across devices by using flexible units and media queries.

4. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**:
   - Designed interactive buttons to encourage user engagement and actions.

5. **Hierarchy & Alignment**:
   - Organized content visually to enhance clarity and ease of navigation.
